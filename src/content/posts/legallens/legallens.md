LegalLens was born out of a challenge: simplifying legal documents for everyday users. During the **Teknasyon Stars of Innovation Hackathon**, my teammate and I built a Flutter app powered by AI to analyze privacy policies and terms of use.

## The Development Process
We had only **30 hours** to develop a working prototype. Here’s what we focused on:
- **Flutter & Riverpod** for state management.
- **Firebase** for authentication & database.
- **GPT-powered chatbot** to break down complex legal terms.
- **MVVM architecture** for clean code structure.

## The Outcome
LegalLens won recognition for its innovation, and we decided to continue development post-hackathon. Today, it’s evolving into a tool that helps users better understand legal agreements effortlessly!
