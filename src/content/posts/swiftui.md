SwiftUI is Apple's modern UI framework that allows developers to build apps faster with a declarative syntax. Here's a quick guide to getting started.

## Why SwiftUI?
- Declarative syntax makes UI code easier to read and maintain.
- Live previews enable faster iteration and design.
- Works across all Apple platforms with minimal adjustments.

## Building Your First App
1. Open Xcode and create a new SwiftUI project.
2. Replace the default `ContentView.swift` code with:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .padding()
            Button("Press Me") {
                print("Button tapped!")
            }
            .padding()
            .background(Color.blue)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .cornerRadius(8)
        }
    }
}
```

3. Run the app in the simulator and see SwiftUI in action!
